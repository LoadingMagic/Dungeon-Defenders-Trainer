# Dungeon-Defenders-Trainer
This is a Dungeon Defenders memory trainer like how cheat engine would work but without the scanning for values. I have moved on past this it was a learning curve for me and I have since moved past using memory based trainers and moved on to hooking and reverse engineering and have made a fully working trainer that is better then this memory based one so why not release this one here for free for everyone to use if they wanted to. These offsets are subject to changing with game version at this time this version supports game version 10.3.14 I hope anyone who finds this will enjoy it and use it for there own good to enjoy the game. Also to open the menu ingame just press Insert.
